# Covid-19-Tracker progressive web app - work in progress

### Demo: https://frozen-cliffs-46702.herokuapp.com/news

### Description

Covid-19-tracker tracks and filters news about COVID-19 from RSS feeds of five finnish news sites. In addition to news, it fetches data and calculates amount of new infections and deaths from COVID-19 API provided by https://covid19api.com/. Report tab combines the data and shows amount of the news, infections and deaths in chart.  
  
By building the app, I wanted to find out is there any correlation between the amount of the news and the COVID-19 infections and death.

### PWA

It is audited with Googles Lighthouse Progressive Web App test and at the moment the results are "Fast and reliable: 1/3, Installable 3/3, PWA optimized 4/8", so there are still little work to do, although some of the fixes are minor.
