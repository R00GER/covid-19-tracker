# covid-19-tracker PWA - work in progress

### Demo: https://frozen-cliffs-46702.herokuapp.com/news

### Description

Covid-19-tracker tracks and filters news about COVID-19 from RSS feeds of five finnish news sites. In addition to news, it fetches new infections and deaths from COVID-19 API provided by https://covid19api.com/. Report tab combines the data and shows amount of the news, infections and deaths in chart.  
  
By building the app, I wanted to find out is there any correlation between the amount of the news and the COVID-19 infections and death.
